UI Theme:
1. Design Principles
Minimalist but Playful → clean UI, generous whitespace, subtle gradients
Engaging but Focused → animations are soft, not distracting
Liquid Glass Aesthetic → translucent panels, frosted blur, layered depth
Consistency → same system for dashboard, study guide, and Let’s Learn
2. Color Palette
Balanced between calm + stimulating.
Primary: #4E9AF1 (calm sky blue, learning focus)
Secondary: #A86CF5 (playful lavender accent)
Background Light Mode: #F7F9FC (soft paper-white)
Background Dark Mode: #10121A (matte dark)
Surface Panels (Glass): White/black with 0.7 opacity + backdrop blur
Accent Highlights: Gradient blends (blue → purple, subtle, liquid feel)
Success/Progress: #4CC38A (mint green)
3. Typography
Headings: Rounded Sans (e.g., SF Pro Rounded, Inter Rounded, or Google’s Plus Jakarta Sans) → gives the “bubbly serious” vibe
Body Text: Neutral Sans (e.g., Inter, SF Pro, or Work Sans)
Notes Editor: Monospace-like style (Fira Code or JetBrains Mono) for clarity
Weights:
Headings → medium/bold
Body → regular
Notes → regular/medium
4. Components Styling
Cards & Panels
Rounded corners: 2xl (smooth, friendly)
Subtle shadows: blurred, spread, low opacity
Glassmorphism: backdrop blur (blur-md), 70% opacity panels
Depth layers: floating panels stacked, like translucent sticky notes
Buttons
Primary: Glass with gradient border (blue → purple)
Hover: subtle inner glow, slightly raised
Secondary: Simple ghost buttons with rounded corners
Inputs
Soft pill-shaped inputs with frosted effect
Focused state: glowing outline in theme gradient
Navigation (Tabs + Sidebar)
Minimal bottom or side nav
Active tab → glassy pill highlight with gradient border
Icons: Rounded line icons (lucide-react works well with slight customization)
5. Animations
Framer Motion everywhere:
Smooth slide/expand for topic outlines
Fade + blur transitions for modals
Bounce-in for list/gallery cards in Let’s Learn
Video → Notes split screen:
Slide animation (panel expands smoothly, glass blur increases)
Notes typing → soft ripple highlight behind cursor (subtle, non-distracting)
6. Let’s Learn Tab Specific UI
List View:
Rows with glass panels, thumbnail left, title + progress right, Start button (gradient pill)
Progress bar under each row (blue → purple gradient)
Gallery View:
Card layout with frosted-glass thumbnails
Hover → floating card effect
Split Screen Mode:
Left Panel (Video): Glass container with rounded corners, darkened backdrop for focus
Right Panel (Notes): White frosted glass with soft lined background (like subtle notebook paper texture)
Floating Controls: Small circular buttons (pause, next, resume) in bottom corner, minimal UI
7. Dark Mode
Background: Deep matte black (#10121A) with liquid gradients subtly in motion (blue → purple wave animations at 5% opacity)
Panels: Dark glass (rgba(20,20,20,0.7)) with frosted blur
Text: White with 80-90% opacity for soft contrast
Notes area: Slightly lighter panel (like dark chalkboard)
